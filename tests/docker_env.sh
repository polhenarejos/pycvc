# docker_env.sh
#
# Purpose
# -------
#
# This is a helper script to enable running tests under a Docker container,
# thus making it easier to get set up as well as isolating test dependencies
# (which include legacy/insecure configurations of openssl and gnutls).
#
# WARNING: the Dockerfile used by this script is no longer maintained! See
# https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-test/blob/master/README.md#quick-start
# for the set of Docker images we use on the CI.
#
# Notes for users
# ---------------
# This script expects a Linux x86_64 system with a recent version of Docker
# installed and available for use, as well as http/https access. If a proxy
# server must be used, invoke this script with the usual environment variables
# (http_proxy and https_proxy) set appropriately. If an alternate Docker
# registry is needed, specify MBEDTLS_DOCKER_REGISTRY to point at the
# host name.
#
#
# Running this script directly will check for Docker availability and set up
# the Docker image.
